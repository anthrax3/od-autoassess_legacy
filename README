**WARNING** Vulnerability scans use known exploits that can potentially shut down services or full systems.
**WARNING** Make sure you have permission to scan the network and that the owner of the network understands
**WARNING** ALL of the risks.

USAGE: od-autoassess [OPTIONS]


Example:

#od-autoassess --client="Home Network" --range=192.168.0.0/24 --profile-only

#od-autoassess --client="Jenny's Laptop" --single-host=192.168.0.104 --profile-only

This is a full (foreign, so local host is removed from scan) scan, scanning each computer with MBSA remotely,
starting openvassd if necessary, using mysql for metasploit, generating custom reports with company name and logo,
and sending the report to the email specified when the scan is done (using a local server such as sendmail)

#od-autoassess --client="Widget's INC" --range=192.168.0.0/24 --foreign \
	--enable-mbsa --mbsa-user=Admin --mbsa-pass=password --mbsa-remote-path="C:\path\to\mbsacli.exe" \
	--start-openvassd --openvas-user="ovas" --openvas-pass="ovas_pass" \
	--metasploit-sql-driver="mysql" --metasploit-sql-conn="mysql:pass@127.0.0.1/metasploit"
	--company-name="Just Two Guys, LLC" --logo-path=/path/to/logo.jpg \
	--send-to="firstguy@justtwoguys.com"
